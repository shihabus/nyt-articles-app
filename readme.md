1. Bootstrap the code as soon as possible
2. Create redux store unprecedented
3. Call function with only arrow functions
4. Make good use of code reusability and compoition
5. Patterns are to be followed
6. Ngnix can be avoided
7. Peer review is entertained
8. Callbacks can be used, but be careful about the binding of this instance inside the class
9. Presentational components are not to be used everywhere
10. React Navigation is to be used for routing
11. Action creatprs are exported from a common index file created in the root actions directory
12. Reducers are bound along with the components inorder to enforce the buck folder pattern
13. We always have an index file in the respective directory so as to export the directory js files
14. JSX are not supported, thus must be avoided at all the cost.
15. Make good use of GitHub. We use git as the version controlled. For new feature create a feature branch. The commits and pushes must be only to that respective branch. Nothing to developement or the master. Before push, get a pull of Development branch.
16. React Native is framework. But it is not that stable. Currently we make use of v0.60. Each version upgrade must be with atmost vigil and care.
17. Redux is a state management library. We have a single store that have the entire application state. 

ALWAYS FOLLOW BEST PRACTICES WHILE CODING EACH MODULE. BEST PRACTISES ARE CLEARLY MARKED DOWN IN README OG GITHUB.
